# New Component Checklist

Use this checklist every time a new component is added.

## Implementation
- [ ] Component exists in `src/components/<name>/` with `.tsx` and `.css`.
- [ ] Props/events/slots documented in the component `readme.md` (if autogenerated, verify output after build).
- [ ] Tokens and spacing follow `src/tokens/tokens.css`.
- [ ] Variants/states match the USPS style guide (sizes, hover/active/disabled, typography, spacing).
- [ ] Keyboard interactions and focus states are implemented where applicable.
- [ ] Update `components.md` with component coverage and gaps.

## Stories
- [ ] Story added in `src/stories/usps-<name>.stories.ts`.
- [ ] Stories cover default + key variants/states (hover/active/disabled where relevant).
- [ ] Story uses realistic content (labels, icons, links).

## Tests
- [ ] Unit tests added (or updated) for core behavior and events.
- [ ] Accessibility checks added (or validated) in Storybook.

## Bindings & Exports
- [ ] Component exported via Stencil build (types in `src/components.d.ts` are updated after build).
- [ ] Framework bindings updated (React/Vue/Angular wrappers or docs) if applicable.
- [ ] Documentation updated (README + TODO as needed).

## Accessibility
- [ ] Semantic HTML is correct (button vs link, headings, lists).
- [ ] ARIA attributes are used only when needed and are accurate.
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA for text/interactive states.

## Style Guide Alignment
- [ ] Visuals match the USPS style guide (colors, icons, spacing, typography).
- [ ] States match the guide (hover/active/selected/error).
- [ ] Any deviations are documented and approved.
